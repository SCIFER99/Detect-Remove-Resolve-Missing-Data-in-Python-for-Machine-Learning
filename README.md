# Detect-Remove-Resolve-Missing-Data-in-Python-for-Machine-Learning
Methods to detect, remove and fill in missing information for Machine Learning/AI engineering purposes.

Hey! I hope all is well! I believe this script is vital to the field of Machine Learning and AI Engineering for many reasons. We can definitely 
expand on these concepts now and future references! 

Step1: Make sure to install these packages before implementing this script:

       pip3 install pandas
       pip3 install openpyxl (for reading and writing Excel files)
       
Step2: That is all! I hope this script is useful for everyone who is practicing in Machine Learning and AI Engineering! 

Happy Coding!
